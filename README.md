## Hi there üëã

I have been working as a data analyst for more than 2 years, I have experience in building ETL processes and developing classic machine learning models. I know how to build reporting and analytics systems, see the physical meaning behind the numbers, automate routine tasks, visualize data, highlighting the main thing.

Looking for a job as a data analyst / data scientist full-time, in office or hybrid format in banks, fintech, raidtech, telecom, industry, consulting.
